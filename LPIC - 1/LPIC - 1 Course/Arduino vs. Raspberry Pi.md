Arduino is a microcontroller designed for simple tasks and direct control of electronic devices, while Raspberry Pi is a more powerful microprocessor that can run a full operating system and handle complex applications. 
The choice between them depends on the project's requirements, with Arduino being better for straightforward control tasks and Raspberry Pi suited for more advanced computing needs.
