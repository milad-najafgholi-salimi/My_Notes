# PCI
Peripheral Component Interconnect. Enables the user to add extra components to the Motherboard. Now most servers use PCI Express (PCIe)
- Internal HDD.
	- PATA (old)
	- SATA (serial & up to 4 devices) (II-III)
	- SCSI (parallel & up to 8 devices) (Small Computer System Interface)
- External HDD. Fiber (Providing a high-speed data connection). SSD over USB
- [[Network card]]s. RJ 45 (Registered Jack 45)
- [[Wireless card]]s. IEEE 802.11
- Bluetooth. IEEE 802.15 (Short-range (up to 10m) wireless technology standard)
- Video accelerators. Hardware circuits on a graphics card that speed up full-motion video.
- Audio cards
## SSD vs HDD
- SSDs are faster (reads up to 10 times and writes up to 20 times faster), quieter, smaller, more durable, and consume less energy, while HDDs are cheaper and offer more storage capacity and easier data recovery if damaged.
---
- SSDs don't have moving parts such as actuator arms and spinning platters like hard drives (an SSD uses flash memory without any moving parts). That's one reason why SSDs can withstand accidental drops and other shocks, vibration, extreme temperatures, and magnetic fields better than HDDs.
---
- HDDs tend to last around 3-5 years, SSDs can last up to 10 years or more. (Current SSDs have reserve capacities. These storage spaces aren't available to the user, but are used to repair damaged cells, so to speak. The defect cells are replaced with brand-new reserve cells; this procedure is called “Bad-Block-Management”. Thus, SSD storage cells in normal operation last a lifetime.)
## Network cards vs Wireless cards
- NIC (Network Interface Card) provides computing network connectivity on a computing device to Ethernet network in Home or Office through RJ45 port. Wireless Adapter Card provides wireless connectivity to computing network enabled by Access Points on premises (in home or office) on a Computing Device.
---
- Wireless cards are installed on an industrial computer is used to enable wireless connectivity to the internet.
## USB
Universal Serial Bus. Serial and need fewer connections. 
USB has many different types.
## GPIO
General Purpose Input Output.
- To control other devices
- Examples include Arduino, raspberrypi, etc. ([[Arduino vs. Raspberry Pi]])
