SQL Select Statement -

    The /SELECT/ statement is used to select data from a database.
    Example - Return data from the /Customers/ table:

    SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;


""" Syntax """
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;


""" Select All Columns """
If you want to return all columns, without specifying every column name, you can use the /SELECT */ syntax:

Example:
SELECT * FROM Customers;





SQL Select Distinct Statement -

The /SELECT DISTINCT/ statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

    Example - Select all the different countries from the "Customers" table:
        SELECT DISTINCT Countriy FROM Customers;

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.


""" Syntax """
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;


""" Count Distinct """
By using the /DISTINCT/ keyword in a function called /COUNT/, we can return the number of different countries.
    Example:
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Countriy) FROM Customers;





SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause -

The /SELECT TOP/ clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The /SELECT TOP/ clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can 
impact performance.

Example - Select only the first 3 records of the Customers table:
    SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;

Note: Not all database systems support the /SELECT TOP/ clause. MySQL supports the /LIMIT/ clause to select 
a limited number of records, while Oracle uses /FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY/ and /ROWNUM/.


""" LIMIT """
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:
    Example - Select the first 3 records of the Customers table:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        LIMIT 3;


""" SQL TOP PERCENT Examplel """
The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):
Example:
    SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;


""" Add a WHERE Clause """
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:
    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country = 'Iran'
        LIMIT 3;


""" Add the ORDER BY keyword """
Add the /ORDER BY/ keyword when you want to sort the result, and return the first 3 records of the sorted result.

The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:
    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        ORDER BY CustomerName DESC
        LIMIT 3;
