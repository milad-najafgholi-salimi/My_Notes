SQL AND Operator - 

The /WHERE/ clause can contain one or many /AND/ operators.

The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Iran that starts with the letter 'M':
    Example - Select all customers from Iran that starts with the letter 'M':
        SELECT * 
        FROM customers
        WHERE Country = "Iran" AND CustomerName LIKE "M%";

""" Syntax """
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;


""" AND vs OR """
The /AND/ operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.
The /OR/ operator displays a record if any of the conditinos are TRUE.

    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country = 'Iran'
        AND City = 'Tehran'
        AND CustoerID > 50;

    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country = 'Iran' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'M%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'S%');

Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Iran that starts with a "M", plus all customers that starts with an "S", regardless of the country value:
    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country = 'Iran' AND CustomerName LIKE 'M%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'S%';




SQL OR Operator -
The /WHERE/ clause can contain one or more /OR/ operators.

The /OR/ operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Iran:

    Example - Select all customers from Germany or Iran:
        SELECT *
        FROM Customers
        WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Iran';

""" Syntax """
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;


The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where either City is "Tehran", CustomerName starts with the letter "M" or Country is "Iran":
    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE City = 'Tehran' OR CustomerName LIKE 'M%' OR Country = 'Iran';
