SQL WHERE Clause -


The WHERE clause is used to filter records. 

[record: "تاریخچه، نوشته، ثبت، بایگانی، یادداشت و ..."]

It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

    Example - Select all customers from Iran:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country="Iran";


""" Syntax """
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Note: The /WHERE/ clause is not only used in /SELECT/ statements, it is also used in /UPDATE/, /DELETE/, etc.!



""" Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields """
SQL requires single quotes around \text values\ (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

However, numeric fields \should not\ be enclosed in quotes:
    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE CustomerID=1;


""" Operators in The WHERE Clause """
You can use other operators than the = operator to filter the search.

    Example - Select all customers with a CustomerID greater than 80:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE CustomerID > 80;

The following operators can be used in the /WHERE/ clause:
=           --->    Equal
>           --->    Greater than
<           --->    Less than
>=          --->    Greater than or equal
<=          --->    Less than or equal
<>          --->    Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
BETWEEN     --->    Between a certain range
    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Products
        WHERE Price BETWEEN 50 AND 60;

LIKE        --->    Search for a pattern
    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE City LIKE 's%'; 
        # Means return every city that starts with 's' and continue of the word. If don't use '%' it will return cities with name 's' and we know there is not such a city.

IN         --->     To specify multiple possible values for a column
    Example:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE City IN ('Paris', 'Tehran');
        # Searches and Returns only 'Paris' and 'Tehran'
