SQL LIKE Operator -

The /LIKE/ operator is used in a /WHERE/ clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the /LIKE/ operator:
    * The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters
    * The underscore sign _ represents one, single character


Example - Select all customers that starts with the letter "M":
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'M%';

# Note: It's not case sensitive.


""" Syntax """
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;


""" The _ Wildcard """
The _ wildcard represents a single character.

It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.

Example - Return all customers from a city that starts with 'T' followed by one wildcard character, 
then 'hr' and then two wildcard characters:
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE city LIKE 'T_hr__';       # The output will be Tehran


""" The % Wildcard """
The % wildcard represents any number of characters, even zero characters.

Example - Return all customers from a city that contains the letter 'T':
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE city LIKE '%T%';


""" Starts With """
To return records that starts with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the end of the letter or phrase.

Example - Return all customers that starts with 'Mi':
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'Mi%';

Tip: You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.

Example - Return all customers that starts with 'm' or starts with 's':
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'M%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'S%';


""" Ends With """
To return records that ends with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the beginning of the letter or phrase.

Example - Return all customers that ends with 'd':
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%d';

Tip: You can also combine "starts with" and "ends with":
    Example - Return all customers that starts with "b" and ends with "s":
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'm%d';


""" Contain """
To return records that contains a specific letter or phrase, add the % both before and after the letter or phrase.

Example - Return all customers that contains the phrase 'il':
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';


""" Combine Wildcards """
Any wildcard, like % and _ , can be used in combination with other wildcards.

Example - Return all customers that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'm___%';

Example - Return all customers that have "i" in the second position:
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_i%';


""" Without Wildcard """
If no wildcard is specified, the phrase has to have an exact match to return a result.

Example - Return all customers from Iran:
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE country LIKE 'Iran';



SQL Wildcards -
A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

Wildcard characters are used with the /LIKE/ operator. The /LIKE/ operator is used in a /WHERE/ clause to search for 
a specified pattern in a column.


""" Wildcard Characters """
