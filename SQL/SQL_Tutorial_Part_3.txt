SQL Select Distinct Statement -

The /SELECT DISTINCT/ statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

    Example - Select all the different countries from the "Customers" table:
        SELECT DISTINCT Countriy FROM Customers;

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.


""" Syntax """
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;


""" Count Distinct """
By using the /DISTINCT/ keyword in a function called /COUNT/, we can return the number of different countries.
    Example:
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Countriy) FROM Customers;
