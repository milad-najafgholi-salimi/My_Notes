SQL IN Operator -

The /IN/ operator allows you to specify multiple values in a /WHERE/ clause.

The /IN/ operator is a shorthand for multiple /OR/ conditions.

Example - Return all customers from 'Iran', 'South Korea', or 'Japan':
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE Country IN ('Iran', 'South Korea', 'Japan');


""" Syntax """
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);


""" NOT IN """
By using the /NOT/ keyword in front of the /IN/ operator, you return all records that are NOT any of the values in the list.

Example - Return all customers that are NOT from 'Iran', 'South Korea', or 'Japan':
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE Country NOT IN ('Iran', 'South Korea', 'Japan');


""" IN (SELECT) """
You can also use /IN/ with a subquery in the /WHERE/ clause.

With a subquery you can return all records from the main query that are present in the result of the subquery.

Example - Return all customers that have an order in the Orders table:
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);


""" NOT IN (SELECT) """
Example - Return all customers that have NOT placed any orders in the Orders table:
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);
