- A vector is simply a list of items that are of the same type. To combine the list of items to a vector, use the c() function and separate the items by a comma. - Example:
```
# vector of strings 
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange")

# print fruits
fruits
```
To create a vector with numerical values in a sequence, use the : operator - Example:
```
# vector with numerical values in a sequence
numbers <- 1:10
numbers
```
You can also create numerical values with decimals in a sequence, but note that if the last element does not 
belong to the sequence, it is not used - Example:
```
# vector with numerical decimals in a sequence
numbers1 <- 1.5: 6.5
numbers1

# vector with numerical decimals in a sequence where the #last element is not used
numbers2 <- 1.5:6.3
numbers2

output:
	[1] 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5
	[1] 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5
```
In the example below, we create a vector of logical values - Example:
```
# vector of logical values
log_values <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

log_values
```

#### Vector Length
- To find out how many items a vector has, use the length() function - Example:
```
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange")
length(fruits)
```
---
#### Sort a Vector
- To sort items in a vector alphabetically or numerically, use the sort() function - Example:
```
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange", "mango", "lemon")
numbers <- c(13, 3, 5, 7, 20, 2)

sort(fruits)   # sort a string
sort(numbers)  # sort numbers
```
---
#### Access Vectors
You can access the vector items by referring to its index number inside brackets []. The first item has index 1, the second item has index 2, and so on - Example:
```
fruits <- ("banana", "apple", "orange")

# Access the first item (banana)
fruits[1]
```
You can also access multiple elements by referring to different index positions with the c() function - Example:
```
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange", "mango", "lemon")

# Access the first and third item (banana and orange)
fruits[c(1, 3)]

# output:
	[1] "banana" "orange"
```
You can also use negative index numbers to access all items except the ones specified - Example:
```
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange", "mango", "lemon")

# Access all items except for the first item
fruits[c(-1)]

# output:
	"apple" "orange" "mango" "lemon"
```
---
#### Change an Item
- To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number - Example:
```
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange", "mango", "lemon")

# Change "banana" to "pear"
fruits[1] <- "pear"

# Print fruits
fruits
```
---
#### Repeat Vectors
- To repeat vectors, use the rep() function - Example:
```
repeat_each <- rep(c(1, 2, 3), each = 3)
repeat_each

# output:
	[1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
```
Repeat the sequence of the vector -Example:
```
repeat_times <- rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = 3)
repeat_times

# output:
	[1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
```
Repeat each value independently - Example:
```
repeat_indepent <- rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = c(5, 2, 1))
repeat_indepent

# output:
	[1] 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3
```
---
#### Generating Sequenced Vectors
One of the examples on top, showed you how to create a vector with numerical values in a sequence with the : operator - Example:
```
numbers <- 1:10
numbers
```
To make bigger or smaller steps in a sequence, use the seq() function - Example:
```
numbers <- seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 20)
numbers
```
Note: The seq() function has three parameters: from is where the sequence starts, to is where the sequence stops, 
and by is the interval of the sequence.
