- A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence -Example:
```
for (x in 1:10) {
	print(x)
}
```
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method 
as found in other object-oriented programming languages.

#### Nested Loops
- It is also possible to place a loop inside another loop. This is called a nested loop.
