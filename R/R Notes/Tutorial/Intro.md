- R is a programming language.
- R is often used for statistical computing and graphical presentation to analyze and visualize data.
- Unlike many other programming languages, you can output code in R without using a print function. - Example:
```
"Hello World!"
```
- Also for numbers, keep it simple like previous one. - Example:
```
4
2
```
- To do simple calculations - Example:
```
2 + 5
7 * 2
```
- However, R does have a print() function available if you want to use it. - Example:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
- And there are times you must use the print() function to output code. - Example:
```
for (x in 1:10) {
	print(x)
}
```
- Conclusion: It is up to you whether you want to use the print() function to output code. 
However, when your code is inside an R expression (e.g. inside curly braces {} like in the example above), 
use the print() function to output the result.
