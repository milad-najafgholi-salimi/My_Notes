- In R, you can use operators to perform common mathematical operations on numbers.
---
#### Built-in Math Function
- R also has many built-in math functions that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
For example, the min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest number in a set. - Example:
```
max(5, 10, 15)
min(5, 10, 15)

# output:
	15
	5
```
- The sqrt() function returns the square root of a number. - Example:
```
sqrt(16)

# output:
	4
```
- The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of a number. - Example:
```
abs(-4.7)

# output:
	4.7
```
- The ceiling() function rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the floor() function rounds a number 
downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result. - Example:
```
ceiling(1.4)
floor(1.4)

# output:
	2
	1
```
