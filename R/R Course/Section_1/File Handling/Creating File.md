- To create a file, use `file.create()` function. Remember to use string as parameter of function:
```
file.create("testingR.txt")
# output will be TRUE if successfully created
```
Also you can create multiple files by separate them with comma `,`:
```
file.create("testingR.txt", "R.csv")
# output will be TRUE TRUE if successfully created
```
