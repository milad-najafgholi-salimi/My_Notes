This is my personal Handbook to understand better subjects. 
My main sources to gathering these information are from:
- **w3schools**
- **Chat-GPT**
- **YouTube** 
- regular **search**
- Paid courses
- Maktabkhooneh.org

Feel free to use if you need. 
To have a beautiful experience, open ***"indexes"*** file in **Obsidian**. 
It's like a wiki-link that links every single file together; You don't need to open files manually. Just search your topic in Sorted lists.

Have fun!
